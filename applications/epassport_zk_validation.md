## Project Overview :
Proposal for the RFP titled [e-Passport ZK Validation](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/Open/epassport-zk-validation.md).

### Overview
The issue of verifying identities on-chain and providing proof of personhood is a challenging one.

e-Passport provides a way to electronically identify individuals. Meanwhile, zero-knowledge technology offers a means to confirm identity without revealing personal data. The e-Passport Zero-Knowledge (ZK) validator project aims to provide zero-knowledge identity validation on the blockchain. 

The NFC reader app will read e-Passport information, which can be uploaded to the blockchain via a Web3 client and anonymized and validated by an on-chain validator.

The project consists of three milestones. The first milestone involves research and a PoC implementation for the NFC reader, DSO upload, and validation logic. The DSO will be validated against a master list of CSCA certificates. In the second milestone, personal data on-chain will be replaced with zero-knowledge proofs. In the final step, additional features will be added to support updates to the master list of certificates.

With this proposal we are targetting for the Milestone 1 of the RFP.

### Project Details
The project aims to verify the data specifications of e-Passports through detailed research. To begin, sample ePassport data will be collected to analyze its structure and content, which will help determine the necessary data to be stored on-chain for verification purposes.

The verification process will involve using public key cryptography to check the Document Security Object (DSO) and Document Signer Certificate (DSC) against the Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA). Once the sample data is analyzed, further verifications will be determined. The project proposes storing the public keys of CSCAs on-chain (root) to enable e-Passport information verification.

To validate the DSO of e-passport information uploaded by users, an ink smart contract implementation will be utilized. If valid, the data will be stored on-chain in the requested account, and since the CSCA will also be stored on-chain, there will be no need for off-chain workers.

An NFC reader implementation will be required to read data from an ePassport. This NFC reader will be part of a web3 client app, most likely a native mobile app, which will submit the read data to the ink smart contract for storage. The first phase of the project will focus on implementing a proof of concept (PoC) for all critical components. Future proposals will address the second and third milestones, which concerns with zk proof implementation and additional features.

## Development Status :
In our intitial research we found the stored data within the ePassport DSO and the required verification steps. Based on our research, below are some verification that must be done to confirm validity of an ePassport:
- EF.SOD signature verification: The structure of EF.SOD is defined as a SignedData structure and we MUST verify its signature
- DS Certificate verification: Verification of the certificate chain up to a known trusted certificate
- Certificate validity period check 
- DS certificate revocation status 
- Comparison between EF.SOD and EF.COM: Compare the content of EF.COM with EF.SOD to make sure that each DG listed in EF.SOD is also contained in EF.COM and vice versa.
- Datagroup integrity check 
- Issuing country comparison (DG1 vs. DS certificate) 

We did a simple PoC on ink smart contract for signature and certificate verification. As a part of PoC, we have verified the signature using the ink built-in ecdsa recover function. Integrated [barebones-x509](https://crates.io/crates/barebones-x509) crate to verify that a certificate is issued by the certificate authority(CA).
